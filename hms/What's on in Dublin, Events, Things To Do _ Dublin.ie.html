Frank Galvin is a washed up veteran lawyer and an alcoholic. He is presented with one last chance to redeem himself when he is given an open-and-shut medical malpractice case that no one thinks he can win.

Beginning is a tender and funny play about the first fragile moments of risking your heart and taking a chance on someone new. Described as an '(anti) romance for [the] 21st century' - Evening Standard, David Eldridge's Beginning is an insightful and touching look at the challenges of connecting and sharing in the era of social media and online dating.

The use of the word 'Famine' in this context is controversial, for Ireland at the time was part of the richest Empire in the World (the British Empire). There was sufficient food in the country throughout the 'Famine' years, yet over a million people died from starvation and disease, and millions more were forced to flee.
